Hi ! I am final year undergraduate student at N.S.I.T. and currently working as Research Intern under Prof Rajiv Ratan Shah at [MIDAS](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) Lab IIITD working on NLP problems. 

## Why Deep Learning?
  Actually, it started with trying to understand game playing agents, which are commonly solved using Reinforcement learning, closing related to how we think about taking decisions. Pretty cool stuff!

## Open to new positions?
  Yeah, I am actually looking forward to work on research-based projects, related to NLP and Vision.
