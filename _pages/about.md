Hi ! I am currently working as Research Assitant (RA) under Prof Rajiv Ratan Shah at <a href="http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/">MIDAS</a> Lab IIITD working on Problems in 3 domains : Speech, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision

## Why Deep Learning?
  Actually, all of it started with trying to understand, How do Humans percieve depth and later working on a problem of how to percieve depth using a single camera only in Robotics.Pretty cool stuff!

## Open to new positions?
  Yeah, I am actually looking forward to work on research-based projects, related to NLP, Speech and computer Vision. Apart from that, I am also open to solving Cognitive science based probelms using AI A.K.A. ML/DL.
