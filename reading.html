<p>I am not gaining any meaningful growth by reading blogs or watching videos at this point of time in my life. <br> Therefore I have started reading books for two reasons:
    <ol>
        <li>Gives the feeling of completeness. and,</li>
        <li>Helps me to leave my desk as I go out for a coffe to read.</li>
    </ol>
    Please build a habit of reading.</p>
