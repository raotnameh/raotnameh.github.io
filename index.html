    <h1>Research Interest</h1>
    My current research interest are:
    <ol>
        <li>Studying how to learn robust high-level representations using unlabelled data. I'm also intersted in leveraging multiple datasets to learn general representations. and,</li>
        <li>Fine-tuning using less labelled data.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I also enjoy working on textual dataset based DL systems. In my spare time, I think how can everyt ing be defined in terms of different dimensions. Please get in touch if you want to collaborate with me on some interesting research oppor tunities.
