I am a Ph.D. Scholar at [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/). I work with [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/team/rajiv-ratn-shah.html) at [MIDAS Lab](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/). I received my B.E from [NSIT](http://www.nsit.ac.in/). 

My current research interest are: 

1. Studying how to make DL based systems robust to unwanted features (noise, accents, gender, age, etc), and
2. Working with low resource. What I mea when I say low resource is: learning Robust represantation of low frequency important examples and secondly, learning Genralize represantations froma on low resource language. 

I'm applying these 2 research ideas on Speech Recognition Systems. In the past I have worked on standard DL based speech recognition systems and End-2End NER from speech directly. I also work on textual input representation based DL systems. Please have a look at my publications for more details. In my spare time, I think how can everyting be defined in therms of different  dimensions. 
Please get in touch if you want to collaborate with me on some interesting research opportunities. My email ID is mohits [at] iiitd [dot] ac [dot] in.
