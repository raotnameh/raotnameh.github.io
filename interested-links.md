> Note 1: If you are looking for a solution to a problem. Do not start with googling it straight away. Understand the problem and come up with a solution of your own, if you can, or at least spend time brain storming the problem or the solution you came up with. For a day or two, work on something else. After this read the literature related and how others are solving it. Lastly, watch lectures/talks on the problem/topic and if you can, please talk to someone knowledgable in this area in person. Ask for his/her opinion and share yours. After this all you need to do is read...read....read....and......read.
