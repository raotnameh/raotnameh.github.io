Here I list down articles and resources which I found interesting and useful. I will highly recommend going through these.

- [Puzzles of Modern Machine Learning](https://windowsontheory.org/2019/11/15/puzzles-of-modern-machine-learning/), by Boaz Barak. The whole blog is interesting; however, this post stands out. This blog provides a great list of fundamental questions about Supervised ML with some pointers to related papers. It's something which can be reread to get some ideas for new projects. There are some gems in its comments too.

- [An Overview of Multi-Task Learning in Deep Neural Networks](https://ruder.io/multi-task/), by Sebastian Ruder.
