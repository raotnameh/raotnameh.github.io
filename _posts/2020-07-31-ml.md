1. Linear algebra

If we have numbers, we can apply functions on them. For example, for an input varaible x 

* \(y = a * x + b\)
In this case, we apply a function on x (input) such that x is multiplied by a number a and then added to b which results into y (output).

One other a function could be Decomposition/Factorization. For example, factorization of an input x

* \[x = m<sub>1</sub> * m<sub>2</sub> * m<sub>3</sub>  \]
In this case, we are factorizing the input into it's prime factors (18 = 2 * 3 * 3).
