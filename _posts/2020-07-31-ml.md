title: CURRENT STATE OF AI

- According to me and I think most of us agree, it all started with rules and still today we are finding rules **ONLY**. All that changed is **NUMBER** of rules. With the advancement in MACHINE LEARNING particularly DEEP LEARNING, we are now finding thousand or million of rules instead of previously 5-10 hand crafted rules.

- There is one other major flaw, the rules work only if they are applied in the order they are trained. If we remove the last layer (last rule) then it breaks. As humans we think of rules are independent and can be used together to make complex assumptions and reasoning. So, I say the today's neural networks are dumb and we should work on smart neural networks.
