1. Linear algebra

If we have numbers, we can apply functions on them. For example, for an input varaible x 

* \[y = a * x + b\]
In this case, on x (input) we apply a function such that it is multiplied by a number a and then added to b results into y (output)
* 

2. Probability
3. Classical ML
4. Classical DL
5. Advance ML
6. Advance DL
