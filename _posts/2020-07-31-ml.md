1. Linear algebra

The numbers can be put into categories, such that, scalar, vectors, matrices and tensors.

* Scalar: It's jus a single number. The naming scheme is using lowercase varibale names (x).
  * x = 2
* Vector: It's an array of numbers. The naming scheme is using bold typeface lowercase varibale names (**x**).
  * **x** = [ x1 x2 x3 ]<sup>T</sup>
* Matrix: It's a 2-D array of numbers. The naming scheme is using bold typeface uppercase variable names (**X**) 
  * **X** = [ X11 X12 X13
                 X21 X22 X23 ]

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 
a & b & c \\
c & d & d\\
e & f & g \\
\end{bmatrix}
\quad
$$
\end{document}
* Tensors: 
If we have numbers, we can apply functions on them. For example, for an input varaible x 

\[y = a * x + b\]
In this case, we apply a function on x (input) such that x is multiplied by a number a and then added to b which results into y (output).

One other a function could be Decomposition/Factorization. For example,

* \[x = m<sub>1</sub> * m<sub>2</sub> * m<sub>3</sub>  \]
In this case, we are factorizing the input into it's prime factors (18 = 2 * 3 * 3).
