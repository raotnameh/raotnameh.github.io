1. Linear algebra

If we have numbers, we can apply functions on them. For example, for an input varaible x 

* \[y = a * x + b\]
In this case, we apply a function on x (input) such that x is multiplied by a number a and then added to b which results into y (output).

One other fucntion could be decomposition. For example, factorization of an input x

* \[x = m1 * m2 * m3  \]
