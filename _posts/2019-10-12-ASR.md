 The whole pipeline to convert speech to text is known as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), which formes the basis for Google's voice assistant sysytems. In this article, you'll learn about the intuition behind the ASR. The article is divided into the following sections:

+ The Big Picture 
+ Understanding Individual elements of ASR pipeline
+ Handling OOV words.

## The Big Picture
ASR Pipeline contains mainly 2 main components: Acoustic Model and a Language Model. The acoustic model is responsible for the acoustic representation and the language models come into the picture to make sense out of the predicted text. Language model also plays an importatn role when there is ambguity in the predictted text. for example, I <blank> you, if you have to choose between NO and KNOW which one whould you choose?
Ofcourse the second one, but why and how you do that? I would say because you have language understanding as one of your cognitive skills,that's how you  did it.  <br /> 
<br />
let's look at a diagram of the whole pipeline, as shown in Fig. 1:

## Understanding Individual elements of ASR pipeline 
<!-- 
+ Find the probabilities of going from one web page to another (respresented using probability transition matrix)
+ Apply the page rank algorithm our the web page until it converges.
 -->
##### Audio : Input is a RAW Audio signal/waveform, which is just the pressure waves recorded/stored digitally at a certain interval of time, or at a certain frequency. 
##### Spectrogram : It's a better representation of an Audio signal, to fed to a Neural Network.
### Acoustic Model : Acoustic models calculates/determines the probabiltiy of output(Y) conditioned on an input(X). The input is either Raw audio or spectrogram and the output is the predicted transcription.For each input Acoustic model ouputs probability of a set of pre-defined characters i.e. P(Y/X) 
### Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) : ctc is a scoring/loss function to calculate the loss of an continous ouput with any Alignment information given. It takes into account all the possible alignments possible for a given output sentence using a Heuristic approach.
### Decoder : Decoder plays an important role in the ASR pipeline. It helps in getting a word error rate (WER) from 30 to under 15 or in some domain specific cases upto under 10 percent (%). The decoding process can be of mainly two types:
+ Without the Language model (LM)
+ With the Language/Character model (LM/CM)



## Implementing Page Rank
Page Rank implementation in python:
```python
import numpy as np
def pagerank(C, eps=0.0001, d=0.85):
    P = np.ones(len(C)) 
    while True:
        P_ = np.ones(len(A))*(1/N)* (1 - d) + d * C.T.dot(P)
        delta = abs(P_ - P).sum()
        if delta <= eps:
            return P_
        P = P_
p=pagerank(C)
#result
#p=[1.16, 0.644, 1.19, 0.15]
```
Final ranking of our example are C > A > B > D !

Notice: page rank of A is high even when it has only one incoming link.
