## Introduction
In this study, we try to address the problem that all DL architectures fail to address i.e., a neural net taking exact number of operations on each and every input independent of the complexity of the input. We call our approach decisions with reasons or a SmartNet. Smart here refers to neural nets capability to decide when to use less features to make a decision.

##### Current state of AI
According to me, it all started with rules and still today we are finding rules ONLY. All that changed is NUMBER of rules. With advancement in MACHINE LEARNING particularly DEEP LEARNING, we are now finding thousand or million of rules instead of previously 5-10 hand crafted rules.

**WE GOTTA PLAY SMART AND NOT HARD.................**

## Dataset used
A subset of ImageNet dataset is used in this study (100 classes and the dataset is balanced) with 3 different augmentations (rotation, horizontal flipping and noise). Furthermore, these 3 augmentation operations are applied recursively N times (N is randomly chosen between 1 to 10). For initial testing purposes, we only use 10 classes to decrease the testing time for different architectures and methods

## Architectures used
For this study, our feature extractor architectire is based on VGG-16.
