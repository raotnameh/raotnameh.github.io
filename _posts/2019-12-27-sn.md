## Introduction
In this study, we try to address the problem that all DL architectures fail to27address i.e., a neural net taking exact number of operations on each and every input no matter the28complexity of the input. We call our approach decisions with reasons or a smart neural net.
smart here refers to neural nets capability to decide when to use less features to make a decision.

##### Current state of AI
According to me, it all started with rules and still today we are finding rules ONLY. All that changed is NUMBER of rules. With advancement in MACHINE LEARNING particularly DEEP LEARNING, we are now finding thousand or million of rules instead of previously 5-10 hand crafted rules.

**WE GOTTA PLAY SMART AND NOT HARD.................**
