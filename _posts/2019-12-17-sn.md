<!-- For inline LaTex, MathJax looks for the \\( ... \\) delimiter. Hence to write a 2 = b 2 as an inline equation, use \\( a^2 = b^2 \\). For displayed equations, the delimiter is either \\[ ... \\]. And so to display a 2 = b 2 + c 2 we would write \\[ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 \\].

I am currently working on smartnets. what it is and why i call them smart?  
smart here refers to neural nets capability to decide when to use less features to make a decision.

##### Current state of AI
According to me, it all started with rules and still today we are finding rules ONLY. All that changed is NUMBER of rules. With advancement in MACHINE LEARNING particularly DEEP LEARNING, we are now finding thousand or million of rules instead of previously 5-10 hand crafted rules.
