### Advance Machine Learning (AML)
+ Link to the assignments done by me for this course, [GitHub](https://github.com/raotnameh/AML_Course)
+ Since it's an advance course, we discuss current SOTA reserach papers. 
+ In this course, we discussed 5 topics: 
  + **Semi-supervised learning**
    1. Zhang et al., "mixup: Beyond Empirical Risk Minimization", ICLR 2018
    2. 
  + **Distance metric learning**
    1. A Metric Learning Reality Check, ECCV 2020
    2. 
  + **Domain adaptation**
    1. Domain Adversarial Neural Networks, JMLR 2016
    2. Jaiswal, Ayush, Daniel Moyer, Greg Ver Steeg, Wael AbdAlmageed, and Premkumar Natarajan. "Invariant Representations through Adversarial Forgetting." In AAAI, pp. 4272-4279. 2020.
    3. Peng, Xingchao, Zijun Huang, Ximeng Sun, and Kate Saenko. "Domain agnostic learning with disentangled representations." arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.12347 (2019). 
    4. Sun, Baochen, Jiashi Feng, and Kate Saenko. "Correlation alignment for unsupervised domain adaptation." In Domain Adaptation in Computer Vision Applications, pp. 153-171. Springer, Cham, 2017.
    5. You, Kaichao, Mingsheng Long, Zhangjie Cao, Jianmin Wang, and Michael I. Jordan. "Universal domain adaptation." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2720-2729. 2019.
