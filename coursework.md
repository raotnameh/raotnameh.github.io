> Currently taking these courses. 
### Convex optimizaiton          



### Advance Machine Learning (AML)
+ Link to the assignments done by me for this course, [GitHub](https://github.com/raotnameh/AML_Course)
+ Since it's an advance course, we discuss current SOTA reserach papers. 
+ In this course, we discussed 5 topics: 
  1. *Semi-supervised learning*
    + Zhang et al., "mixup: Beyond Empirical Risk Minimization", ICLR 2018 
  2. *Distance metric learning*
    + A Metric Learning Reality Check, ECCV 2020 
  3. *Domain adaptation*
    + Domain Adversarial Neural Networks, JMLR 2016
    + Jaiswal, Ayush, Daniel Moyer, Greg Ver Steeg, Wael AbdAlmageed, and Premkumar Natarajan. "Invariant Representations through Adversarial Forgetting." In AAAI, pp. 4272-4279. 2020.
    + Peng, Xingchao, Zijun Huang, Ximeng Sun, and Kate Saenko. "Domain agnostic learning with disentangled representations." arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.12347 (2019). 
    + Sun, Baochen, Jiashi Feng, and Kate Saenko. "Correlation alignment for unsupervised domain adaptation." In Domain Adaptation in Computer Vision Applications, pp. 153-171. Springer, Cham, 2017.
    + You, Kaichao, Mingsheng Long, Zhangjie Cao, Jianmin Wang, and Michael I. Jordan. "Universal domain adaptation." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2720-2729. 2019.
